## C# New Hire Project

Using Visual Studio, create an API project. Write an API endpoint called CalculateTimeAngle which takes either a time parameter, or an hour and minute parameter.


Given a clock, 12 represents 0 degrees. 3 would represent 90 degrees and so on.


The endpoint will calculate the sum of the hour hand degrees and minute hand degrees.  So, for example, 3:00 would be 90 degrees as the hour hand (3) would be 90 degrees and the minute hand (12) would be 0 degrees.  Return the calculation.


As a bonus (not required), write the unit tests.


This should take you no more than an hour to finish.


FYI, we already ran this project through ChatGPT. We know what it looks like.  If your code is a copy/paste of that, you will be disqualified.  We want original thinking.
